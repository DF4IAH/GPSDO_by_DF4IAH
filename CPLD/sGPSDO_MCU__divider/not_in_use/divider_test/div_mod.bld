WARNING:ConstraintSystem - The Offset constraint <NET "reset" OFFSET = IN 10 ns
   BEFORE "phase_in";> [top_constraints.ucf(7)], is specified without a
   duration.  This will result in a lack of hold time checks in timing reports. 
   If hold time checks are desired a duration value should be specified
   following the 'VALID' keyword.
